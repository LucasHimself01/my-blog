# Introduction

One of the ways that social media platforms like Instagram, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter distract us is by
presenting us with so much content and so many small dopamine hits that our brains become
addicted to the never ending slot machine loop of death that lives within the reach of our pocket.

Something you can do to declutter your experience, to make it more humane, simple and minimal
is to become very strict about what you let into your brain.

# Reducing digital clutter

Just like how you should be very careful about what you put into your body if you want it to be the healthiest,
you should be very careful about the inputs you allow into your brain if you want to have a healthy mind.

Reducing digital clutter is ultimately about respecting your own time and limited brain resources. Digital
clutter has a heavier cost on your brain’s CPU cycles then you think. You only have a limited brain capacity,
and by limiting your inputs you are allowing your mind to focus on more important things.

One of the ways to minimize this effect is to perform what is called a Mass Unfollow.

# Mass Unfollow

The idea of the Mass Unfollow is to reduce the inputs you let into our brain so that you can focus on better things.

Here are the list of steps you can take to perform a Mass Unfollow:

### Unfollow Old Friends & Not-so-close Friends

Be very rigorous about who you let into your social media feed. If you don't want to see them everyday in real life, don't let them in to your digital environment every day.

The [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), which is 150, is a good place to start as a limit of people you follow on social media, although I believe you can reduce this to 50 or 20 if you
are honest and rigorous enough about who you want to let into your digital life.

### Mass Mute

Mute mercilessly, if you follow someone close to you but don't need to see all their content, mute it.

### Leave Groups and Unlike Pages

Be very rigorous about groups and pages that you follow, only let in those that are very meaningful and important to you.

### Don't Follow Entertainment Pages

This is a lifestyle changer. Prioritize real world activities with real people and moving your real body over being entertained at home.

### Unfollow All Celebrities

Keeping up with celebrities is not a good use of your time. They are often paid to promote products and subtely influence you towards some form of consumption
and can lead to unhealthy standards and comparison.

### Unfollow Content Creators

You probably follow some influencers or content creators that you think are beneficial to you since they teach you a lot of positive things that genuinely improve your life.

Still, I would suggest to you to think about whether you want to let every piece of their content/life/work into your brain at all times.
g.

You can still search for information on the internet and you can still search for content from the very creators you have unsubscribed,
but you are now doing it on your own terms. With this strategy you are the one who decides when to be shown a piece of content or information,
not an algorithm that is tracking you and addicting you to the platform.

In short, prioritize reaching content, instead of letting it reach you, let yourself be sovereign over the content youy consume.

# Conclusion

After performing these steps you should have a more clear, minimal, mindful, humane, meaningful and intentional experience of social media.

You might find that, as a great side effect, you also end up using social media apps less and less :)
