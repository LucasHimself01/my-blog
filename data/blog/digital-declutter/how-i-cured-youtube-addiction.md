# Introduction

I used to spend hours daily scrolling on youtube and binge watching various kinds of content.

As I reflected on how I was using my time and how a lot of it was essentially wasted on youtube, I decided to do something about it.

These are the things I did that reduced the amount of youtube I watched from 2 hours daily to 20 minutes, in average.

## Unsubscribe everything

You don't need as many subscriptions as you think. I think that, instead of subscribing to channels that you are interested in, there is a better mental model to approach content consumption: instead of
consuming feeds, rely more on search.

What this means in practice is that, for example, instead of subscribing to your favourite yoga channel, firstly, don't, and then, each time you wanna do a follow along yoga class, search specifically
for a video of that kind. You can even search for it specifically from your favourite channel, but keeping it unsubscribed has many advantages:

### Intentionality

One of the reasons you might use youtube so much is that you follow up with and what the content from your subscriptions every time they post.
At the very least, you are presented their content on the Subscriptions tab of the Youtube app.

This leads you to do scrolling and being presented things that you _might_ want to watch, instead of having an experience where you specifically reach for the content you want at a certain moment.

I believe this is more important than most people realize, because your consumption habits now become more mindful, purposeful and came from an intention that YOU had, instead of being manipulated by
an endless stream of content from a feed or the recommendations of an algorithm.

### The Slot Machine Dynamic

The Youtube app is built for you to feel the urge to check it as often as possible, and for as long as possible, to feed Google's ad business and to improve its recommendation algorithm.

It is built also for you to get the dopamine rush when checking if there is something new in your subscription box, or on your recommendation page.

To improve your digital sovereignty, focus and productivity, it is important to avoid this slot machine dynamic as much as possible.

You can do this by removing all subscriptions and always searching for what you are looking for.

## Google's Surveillance Program

If you are a user of Google's products, I strongly suggest that you disable all its tracking mechanisms to reclaim sovereignty over your data and personal information.

In the context of this post though, what I did was opt out of the youtube history option. After opting out, the recommendation algorithm will not use your personal data to improve its suggestions for you,
and the homepage of youtube will not present any suggestions to you, which also greatly diminishes the Slot Machine Dynamic.

## No Phone App

Removing the app from your phone may be a great way to add some friction to the usage of this app. If something is really important for you to watch, use the phone's browser or the computer to do so.

## Declutter

Cleaning up your watch later and other playlists can also be an important step towards a cleaner youtube usage.

I've found that most videos on my playlists and watch later were useless, or I would not truly watch those videos ever in the future, unless I specifically searched for them again.

# Conclusion

These were the steps I took to greatly reduce my youtube usage, which has given me the time to do other better things, like writing this post :).
